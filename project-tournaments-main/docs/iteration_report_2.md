# What was planned but not finished.

Some unit tests were not done due to time and still have questions on how to implement unit tests for creating a bracket. #What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.
Setting up the initializations was tricky especially the module name.
The username storing works, but the password storing and functionality still needs to be put in place.
The bracket creator isn't working completely and still needs some work.
# What adjustments to your overall design you discovered?

We didn't find anything that needs to be adjusted this week.
# One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.

Using github has been useful. All of us have never really used version control and through github it has been pretty easy to collaborate with one another.
The github project boards are also a great tool to organize tasks and user stories.

2.Task for: Task for: Tripp Lerch

As a user, I want to select between manual and randomized seeding, so that I can determine who will match up against each other in the tournament.

Priority: MED

Estimate: 1

3.Task for: Test step 2 Test step 3

3.Task for: Kyle Brandtjen

4.Task for: Ian Purvis

Bracket Creation (implemention 1)

As a user, I want to input a number of players up to 64, so that I can have the application create the tournament format for me.
