### Steps to reproduce:
1. Click on "Create Tournament" 2. Input data into text boxes 3. Click submit button on botton of form - Expected Results: Create a tournament and be able to view it somewhere within the page - Actual Results: Create a tournament but does not appear anywhere within the site.
