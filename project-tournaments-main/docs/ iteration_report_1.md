#What was planned but not finished.
* Some unit tests were not done due to time and still have questions on how to implement unit tests for creating a bracket. 
#What troubles/issues/roadblocks/difficulties you encountered.
* Setting up the initializations was tricky especially the module name. 
* Time management and dependencies were also a difficulty due to this being the first iteration. 

#What adjustments to your overall design you discovered? 
* A adjustment which will happen most likely through the project will be the schema. As we add more features we will need to update the schema so can collect and show more data. 

#One tool or process or approach you used that you felt was especially helpful, and why.
* Using github has been useful. All of us have never really used version control and through github it has been pretty easy to collaborate with one another. 
* The github project boards are also a great tool to organize tasks and user stories.
